Welcome to my version of the classic Pac Man game
The following are the instructions of the game:
Use keyboard buttons left, right, up, and down arrow to have your character Pac Man collect all the coins
Watch out for red objects, they are ghosts, and they eat pac man so keep away from them.
Successfully collect all the coins without the ghosts eating your Pac Man and you win!
